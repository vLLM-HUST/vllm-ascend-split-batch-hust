# Split-batch host contract proposal

The extracted planner is pure and default-off. Runtime activation requires:

1. `vllm.graph.runtime-key.v1`: validated, bounded opaque graph metadata;
2. `vllm.forward.split-context.v1`: per-forward split mode and stream identity;
3. `vllm.ascend.graph-pool.v1`: separately owned main/parallel graph pools;
4. `vllm.worker.split-executor.v1`: execute a committed plan and restore all
   buffers/context on success, error, or cancellation.

The provider must reject speculative decoding, LoRA, MLA, M-RoPE, non-uniform
decode, unsupported graph modes, and unknown capture sizes. It must never lazily
capture an unbounded key set or modify global forward context outside a scoped
context manager.
